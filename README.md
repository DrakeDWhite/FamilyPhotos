# What is this directory?

This is a final project for Information Organization and Retrieval at University of California, Berkeley. It is intended as the beginning phase of a personal project to digitize all family photos in the White-Fields family. It is also intended to serve as a starting point for building a search engine around faceted metadata and keyword search functionality on this collection.

# How do I run this repository?
1. Download the full directory onto a computer with Python installed.
    - See [the Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to see how this is done. 
2. Run (double-click) FamilyPhotos.py
3. Fill out the search queries (detailed below) for the GUI that shows up. and at that, bish bash bosh, bobs your uncle. your results will open in your default browser window. 
    - *Ironically, I do have a distant Great Uncle Bob, but don't have any photos of him in this collection.*

# How does the search engine work?

This is my humble GUI. It's relatively straightforward, but I'll cover each field here in detail.

**Keyword** - optional -  as of now, we only support a single keyword in this field. It can be any keyword you like, and you can hit the "See what keywords are available" button to see a comprehensive list of possible options. These are coded manually to each image.

**Person** - optional - a dropdown that displays all possible people in this collection. You can only choose one at a time.

**Place** - optional - a dropdown that displays all possible places where pictures in this collection have been taken. You can only choose one at a time.

**Decade** - optional - a dropdown that displays all possible decades encompassed by this collection. You can only choose one at a time.


Every filter can be filtered alone, or in tandem with any other of the filters. The program will tell you if there are no results or if what you tried doesn't work, so bash away at the program! and as the tooltext says at the bottom - you can leave all filters blank and see all images in this collection.
