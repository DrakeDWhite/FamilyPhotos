# What is this directory?

This is a final project for Information Organization and Retrieval at University of California, Berkeley. It is intended as the beginning phase of a personal project to digitize all family photos in the White-Fields family. It is also intended to serve as a starting point for building a search engine around faceted metadata and keyword search functionality on this collection.

# How do I run this repository?
1. Download the full directory onto a computer with Python installed.
    - See [the Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to see how this is done. 
2. Run (double-click) FamilyPhotos.py
3. Bish Bash Bosh, Bob's your uncle. 
    - *Ironically, I do have a distant Great Uncle Bob, but don't have any photos of him in this collection.*

### TO-DO
- Allow multiple people to be selected, but only allow one time and one place
    - Allow this to display a list of possible keywords if requests
        - OPTIONAL: cater the list keywords based on what filters are active
- Update readme with screenshots on how the tool works 
- A "display all" button that displays all pictures on the web page.
