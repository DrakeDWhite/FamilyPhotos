# What is this directory?

This is a final project for Information Organization and Retrieval at University of California, Berkeley. It is intended as the beginning phase of a personal project to digitize all family photos in the White-Fields family. It is also intended to serve as a starting point for building a search engine around faceted metadata and keyword search functionality on this collection.

# How do I run this repository?
1. Download the full directory onto a computer with Python installed.
    - See [the Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to see how this is done. 
2. Run (double-click) main.py. 
3. Bish Bash Bosh, Bob's your uncle. 
    - *Ironically, I do have a distant Great Uncle Bob, but don't have any photos of him in this collection.*

### TO-DO
- Be sure to support at scale, so everything can be scaled up based on what we enter in the Family_Key.csv
- Display all possible categories (people, place, time) recursively without messing up the GUI
- Allow multiple people to be selected, but only allow one time and one place
- While having radio buttons selected, allow for searching from keywords
- place a text box widget that the system can either print messages in relation to what has been searched, or the link to the website with the images compiled, or a failure message
    - Allow this to display a list of possible keywords if requests
        - OPTIONAL: cater the list keywords based on what filters are active
- Update readme with screenshots on how the tool works 
- A "display all" button that displays all pictures on the web page.
